Examples of Project  Software include the xBFreE library for calculations, xBFreE-Analyzer for data visualization and its associated  extensions and dependencies. </p> <p>The Project is developed by a team of distributed developers, called Contributors. Contributors are individuals who  have contributed code, documentation, designs or other work to one or more Project repositories.  Contributors are  also known by the name \"xBFreE Development Team (XDT)\" in the project license.  Anyone can be a Contributor.  Contributors can be affiliated with any legal entity or none. Contributors participate in the project by submitting,  reviewing and discussing GitHub Pull Requests and Issues and participating in open and public Project discussions on  GitHub, Google Groups and mailing lists.

If a Council Member becomes inactive for a period of 6 months,  they will be approached by the PL to see if they plan on returning to active participation.  If not they will be  asked to step down.  If the Council Member indicates they intend to be active again but have not done so after 1  month the Council may vote to remove them.</p> <p>If a Council Member leaves the council early they may be replaced, using the same process as above.  Their  replacement will join the same class and serve the remainder of the 2 years.</p> <p>Each class can fluctuate between 2 and 3 members so long as the total council size (including the PL) is between 5  and 7.  If a class gets too small, an additional member must be recruited.</p> <p>All former Council members can be considered for membership again at anytime in the future, like any other Project  Contributor.

Because of this, it is possible that Members will have conflicts of  interest. Such conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>Financial interests, such as investments, employment or contracting work, outside The Project that may     influence their work on The Project.</li> <li>Access to proprietary information of their employer that could potentially leak into their work with the Project.</li> <li>An issue where the person privately gains an advantage from The Project resources, but The Project has no gain or    suffers a disadvantage. </li> </ul> <p>All members of the Council, PL included, shall disclose to the rest of the Council any conflict of interest they may  have. Members with a conflict of interest in a particular issue may participate in Council discussions on that issue, but must recuse themselves from voting on the issue.

No outside institution, individual or legal  entity has the ability to own, control, usurp or influence the project other than by participating in the Project as  Contributors and Council Members. However, because institutions are the primary funding mechanism for the project,  it is important to formally acknowledge institutional participation in the project.

The pull request is then refined in response to public comment and review, with the goal being consensus in the  community.  After this open period, a Steering Council Member proposes to the Steering Council that the changes be  ratified and the pull request merged (accepting the proposed changes) or proposes that the pull request be closed  without merging (rejecting the proposed changes).  The Member should state the final commit hash in the pull request  being proposed for acceptance or rejection and briefly summarize the pull request. The full Steering Council must  vote and at least \u2154 of the votes must be positive to carry out the proposed action (fractions of a vote rounded up  to the nearest integer).
