# Binding free energy calculation with GBNSR6 model

!!! info
    This example can be found in the [examples/GBNSR6][6] directory in the repository folder. If you didn't
    use gmx_MMPBSA_test before, use [downgit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home) to download the specific folder from 
    gmx_MMPBSA GitHub repository.

## Requirements

In this case, `gmx_MMPBSA` requires:

| Input File required            | Required |           Type             | Description |
|:-------------------------------|:--------:|:--------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| The MD Structure+mass(db) file | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |    `tpr` `pdb`    | Structure file containing the system coordinates |
| An index file                  | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |          `ndx`    | File containing the receptor and ligand in separated groups |
| Receptor and ligand group      | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } |        `integers`       | Group numbers in the index files |
| A trajectory file              | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req .scale_icon_medium } | `xtc` `pdb` `trr` | Final GROMACS MD trajectory, fitted and with no pbc. |
| A topology file                | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_opt .scale_icon_medium }    |           `top`         | GROMACS topology file (The `* .itp` files defined in the topology must be in the same folder |
| A Reference Structure file     | :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_optrec .scale_icon_medium } |           `pdb`         | Complex reference structure file (without hydrogens) with the desired assignment of chain ID and residue numbers |
              
:octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req } -> Must be defined -- :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_optrec } -> 
Optional, but recommended -- :octicons-check-circle-fill-16:{ .req_opt } -> Optional

_See a detailed list of all the flags in gmx_MMPBSA command line [here][1]_

## Command-line
That being said, once you are in the folder containing all files, the command-line will be as follows:

=== "Serial"

        gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ct com_traj.xtc -ci index.ndx -cg 3 4 -cp topol.top -o FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat -eo FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv

=== "With MPI"

        mpirun -np 2 gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ct com_traj.xtc -ci index.ndx -cg 3 4 -cp topol.top -o FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat -eo FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv

where the `mmpbsa.in` input file, is a text file containing the following lines:

``` yaml linenums="1" title="Sample input file for GB calculation using GBNSR6 model"
Sample input file for GB calculation using GBNSR6 model
#This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. 
Although, we tried to use the input files as recommended in the
#Amber manual, some parameters have been changed to perform 
more expensive calculations in a reasonable amount of time. 
Feel free to change the parameters 
#according to what is better 
for your system.

&general
sys_name="GBNSR6",
startframe=1,
endframe=10,
forcefields="leaprc.protein.ff14SB"
/

&gbnsr6
istrng=0.15
/
```

!!! info "Keep in mind"
    See a detailed list of all the options in `gmx_MMPBSA` input file [here][2] as well as several [examples][3]. 
    These examples are meant only to show that gmx_MMPBSA works. It is recommended to go over these variables, even 
    the ones that are not included in this input file but are available for the calculation that it's performed and
    see the values they can take (check the [input file section](../../input_file.md)). This will allow you to 
    tackle a number of potential problems or simply use fancier approximations in your calculations.

## Considerations
In this case, a single trajectory (ST) approximation is followed, which means the receptor and ligand structures and 
trajectories will be obtained from that of the complex. To do so, an MD Structure+mass(db) file (`com.tpr`), an 
index file (`index.ndx`), a trajectory file (`com_traj.xtc`), and both the receptor and ligand group numbers in the 
index file (`3 4`) are needed. The `mmpbsa.in` input file will contain all the 
parameters needed for the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation. In this case, 10 frames are going to be used when performing the 
MM/PB(GB)SA calculation using the GBNSR6 model.

!!! note "Comments on GBNSR6 model"
    * GBNSR6 is an implementation of the Generalized Born (GB) model in which the effective Born radii are computed 
    numerically, via the so-called "R6" integration ([ref.][222]) over molecular surface of the solute. 
    * In contrast to most GB practical models, GBNSR6 model is parameter free in the same sense as the numerical 
    PB framework is. Thus, accuracy of GBNSR6 relative to the PB standard is virtually unaffected by the choice of 
    input atomic radii. 
    * Check Chapter [ยง5](https://ambermd.org/doc12/Amber21.pdf#chapter.5) in Amber manual for a more thorough 
    description of the GBNSR6 model and its parameters.

A plain text output file with all the statistics (default: `FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat`) and a CSV-format 
output file containing all energy terms for every frame in every calculation will be saved. The file name in 
'-eo' flag will be forced to end in [.csv] (`FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.csv` in this case). This file is only written when 
specified on the command-line.


!!! note
    Once the calculation is done, the results can be analyzed in `gmx_MMPBSA_ana` (if `-nogui` flag was not used in 
    the command-line). 
    Please, check the [gmx_MMPBSA_ana][5] section for more information.
