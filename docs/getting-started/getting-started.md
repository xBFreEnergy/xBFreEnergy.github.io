## What is xBFreE?
**xBFreE** [ **x** (any BFE method) **B**inding **Fre**e **E**nergy) is a robust tool to compute the Binding Free 
Energy (BFE) with multiples method for the most popular Molecular Dynamics Programs. xBFreE is not only the natural 
evolution of gmx_MMPBSA, but also an ambitious project to democratice any BFE method in easy-to-use and better way.

## **What can be done with xBFreE?**
Multiple calculations can be performed with **xBFreE** such as:

* At the moment only MMPBSA methodologies[^1] can be performed.

## **xBFreE** a quick overview
[**xBFreE**](howworks.md) is a python application that carries out several BFE calculations. The **xBFreE** results can 
be analyzed with [**xBFreE-Analyzer**](../analyzer.md) which provides an intuitive way to analyze the data through 
visually and well-structured charts and save high-quality pictures. You can test if your **xBFreE** installation 
work well using [**xBFreE-Tester**](../examples/gmx_MMPBSA_test.md#gmx_mmpbsa_test-command-line) by running one or more 
available [examples](../examples/README.md) in **xBFreE**.

## **Installation**

## **Need help?**
[Help](../Q&A/README.md) section contains the most frequently asked questions and errors. Also, look at our 
[Google group](https://groups.google.com/x/xbfree) or the [issues](https://github.com/xBFreEnergy/xBFreE/issues) 
section to find out about specific cases and others.

If you have any question, doubt, suggestion or want to talk about any theme, please, consider open a new 
[discussion](https://github.com/xBFreEnergy/xBFreE/discussions) 

## Follow **xBFreE**
Visit [Pypi Stats](https://pypistats.org/packages/**xBFreE**) or [PePy](https://pepy.tech/project/**xBFreE**)
to see how **xBFreE** is doing.

## **Collaboration**

We are opened to any collaboration.  If you want to implement any method developed by your Lab we can help you. Also,
if you are interested in including xBFreE in your divulgation program, we can help you to optimize the content and 
including it in our oficial documentation.

Feel free to contact us through our Google group (https://groups.google.com/x/xbfree) for more details...
