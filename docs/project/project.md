# Project

## Abstract
The development of methods to compute the BFE has contributed to considerably accelerating drug discovery. New 
methods, derivatives, or improvements to existing ones are constantly being generated. In most cases, these methods 
remain sparse and are rarely used due to their lack of implementation. It is for them that we are launching xBFreE, 
a project dedicated to implementing, testing, and developing BFE methods described in the literature.     


## Motivation

We strongly believe that even the most promising idea loses its potential if it remains confined to a scientific 
article and cannot be utilized in a simple and accessible manner.
