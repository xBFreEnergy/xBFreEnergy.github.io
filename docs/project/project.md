# Project

## Abstract
The development of methods to compute the BFE has contributed to considerably accelerating drug discovery. New 
methods, derivatives, or improvements to existing ones are constantly being generated. In most cases, these methods 
remain sparse and are rarely used due to their lack of implementation. It is for them that we are launching xBFreE, 
a project dedicated to implementing, testing, and developing BFE methods described in the literature.     


## Motivation
We believe that an idea, no matter how much potential it may have, dies in a scientific article if it cannot be 
used in a simple and accessible way.
