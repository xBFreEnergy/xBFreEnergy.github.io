Like us, many researchers do not have their own resources or cannot finance programs external to their research. We 
appreciate any contribution, no matter how small.

## Sponsors
_xBFreE Project and all its tools are completely free._

Sponsors are people, institutions, or other entities that believe our work is relevant to them and the community. 
Its main benefit will be priority attention in issues solving and new features implementation. But the idea of 
funding is to support the xBFreE development for the community.

_**Thank you to everyone for your bit for this project.**_
