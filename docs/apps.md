    xBFreE is a tool for calculating binding free energy. Although it is the natural evolution of gmx_MMPBSA to 
    extend its functionalities to other MD programs, it also seeks to fulfill another objective. The idea behind the 
    same-name project is to provide the scientific community with a robust tool that contains most of the most used 
    BFE methods.

    Like xBFreE, xBFreE-Analyzer arises from gmx_MMPBSA (gmx_MMPBSA_ana). xBFreE-Analyzer is a powerful graphical 
    tool to carry out the analysis of the results obtained with xBFreE.
